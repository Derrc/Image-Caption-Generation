# Image Caption Generator
- Implementation of CNN-LSTM with Soft Attention using Encoder/Decoder architecture
- Uses ResNet-34 as the CNN Encoder, LSTM with Attention Network as Decoder
- Trained on Flikr8k dataset
- Hosted locally using Flask/Python/Pytorch for the backend and React/Typescript for the frontend
- Small project that I plan to build upon in the future

# Future Work
- Train on larger datasets (Flickr30k, MSCOCO)
- Implement state-of-the-art models
- Enhance React UI

# Resources
- [Show, Attend, and Tell](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03044.pdf)
